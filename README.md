# Machine Learning from Scratch ðŸ’»

Welcome to my personal journey of understanding how machine learning really works under the hood. This repo is not meant to be super polished or production-ready  itâ€™s a playground where I try to build everything from scratch just to **learn deeply**.

###  What's the goal?

I wanted to move beyond using `sklearn` blindly â€” instead, Iâ€™m trying to recreate:

- Label Encoder
- Train-Test Split
- Machine Learning Algorithms (like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Math behind the scenes (gradients, loss functions, etc.)
- Utility functions that make the ML pipeline work

Basically, I want to know whatâ€™s happening inside the libraries we usually import.

lets see how it goes :)
