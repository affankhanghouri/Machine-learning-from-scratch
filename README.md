# Machine Learning from Scratch 🧠💻

Welcome to my personal journey of understanding how machine learning really works under the hood. This repo is not meant to be super polished or production-ready — it’s a playground where I try to build everything from scratch just to **learn deeply**.

### 🌱 What's the goal?

I wanted to move beyond using `sklearn` blindly — instead, I’m trying to recreate:

- Label Encoder
- Train-Test Split
- Machine Learning Algorithms (like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Math behind the scenes (gradients, loss functions, etc.)
- Utility functions that make the ML pipeline work

Basically, I want to know what’s happening inside the libraries we usually import.
